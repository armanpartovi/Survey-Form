You should start the Survey Form exercise using HTML. The deadline is next Wednesday 21st.

Please, create a new repository for that.

Next Monday 19th we will resolve doubts about it and it would be awesome if you can bring the some initial code for the Survey Form to explain what you've been working on and solve any doubts you may have.
.
Follow the instructions explained here:
